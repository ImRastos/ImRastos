Hello! My name is Tyler Dix and I am an aspiring software developer!

My background is in EHS and Operational Compliance, and I have a B.S. in Geology!
So I can tell you with authority...Software development rocks! Man, can't take a good ice breaker for granite.

Projects I'm currently working on / theory crafting:
1. A recipe app that has a focus on ease of use and functionality to export ingredients
2. A text based adventure game titled "Candelabra"
3. A Chrome Extension that integrates Spotify
4. A few others that are not fleshed out as of yet

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn if you would like to chat or discuss software development!

Warmest regards,
Tyler Dix
