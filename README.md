Hello! My name is Tyler Dix and I am an aspiring software developer!

My background is in EHS and Operational Compliance, and I have a B.S. in Geology!
So I can tell you with authority...Software development rocks! Man, can't take a good ice breaker for granite.

Projects I'm currently working on / theory crafting:
1. A recipe app that has a focus on ease of use and functionality to export ingredients
2. A text based adventure game titled "Candelabra"
3. A Chrome Extension that integrates Spotify
4. A few others that are not fleshed out as of yet

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn if you would like to chat or discuss software development!
